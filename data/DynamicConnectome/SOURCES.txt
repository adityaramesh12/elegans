Comments
——————————————————
The files include the adjacency matrix, the labels of the neurons, and the spatial positions of the neurons as two-dimensional coordinates (unit is mm).

Two-dimensional position from Choe:
Choe Y, McCormick BH, Koh W (2004) Network connectivity analysis on the temporally augmented C. elegans web: A pilot study. Soc Neurosci Abstr 30: 921.9.

Transverse axis (side-to-side/left-to-right?) not considered. ”Because the animal extends mainly along one axis, it has been noted that the “layout problem is roughly one-dimensional” as “the length:diameter ratio of the worm body is about 20:1””.

Connectivity from White:
White JG, Southgate E, Thomson JN, Brenner S (1986) The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 314: 1–340.
