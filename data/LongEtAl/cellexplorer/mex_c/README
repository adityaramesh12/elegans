This folder and subfolder contain the C/C++ codes to generate the mex functions
that would be needed to run the C. elegans nuclei straightening and segmentation
pipeline.

** How to compile **

Start your Matlab, and cd the folder "mex_func", then type the command

>> makeosmex_wormseg

Then you should have all mex functions generated under the folder "mex_func".

** Trouble-shooting **

If you cannot compile successfully, there may be two reasons.

(1) You have not installed/setup correctly the c++ mex compiling environment.
For Mac or Linux, you can run the command "mex -setup" to setup this environment.
For Windows, depending on which compiler you want to use, the methods to setup 
are different, - if you'd like to use Open Source MinGW to compile, you can google 
search "MinGW and Matlab".  

(2) You may not have the public domain libraries libtiff, libjpeg, libzlib installed
properly. But this is unlikely, as Matlab should have these installed by default. 
Note that if you want to use the compiled function "loadRaw2Stack_c" to read Zeiss
LSM file, you will need to use a customary version of libtiff produced by Hanchuan Peng.
